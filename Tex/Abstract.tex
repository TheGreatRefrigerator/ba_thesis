The goal of the present bachelor thesis was to develop a prototypical Routing-Profile for Fireengines in a research cooperation with the voluntary fire department in LÃ¼tzelburg (in swabia).
\medskip

So far there is no routing-service considering that emergency vehicles are allowed to ignore the StVO\footnote{german road traffic regulation}.
Based on the Openrouteservice using OpenStreetMap as data pool, an Emergency Profile was developed, which uses reasonable speeds for emergency vehicles and is allowed to drive on cycling-ways, pedestrian zones and additional waytypes.Furthermore oneways can be passed through from the opposite direction.
The delay for acceleration and break processes were taken into account with time penalties for starting, turns and arrival.
The Profile was calibrated through analytical comparison of three Test runs.
The results show, that a function for the steepness has yet to be added.
Differences in Travel times for the minute markers of the two mostly level test routes were mostly in 10 second range.

The Author wants to provide a basis for more accurate routing and travel time calculation for emergency vehicles as well as assistance in the development for demand plans.
